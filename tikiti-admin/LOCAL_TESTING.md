# üß™ Local Testing Guide

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd tikiti-admin
npm install
```

### 2. Setup Environment
```bash
# Copy environment template
cp env.example .env

# Edit .env with your Firebase config

  "uid": "the_user_uid_from_auth",
  "email": "admin@test.com",
  "displayName": "Test Admin",
  "role": "admin",
  "permissions": ["all"],
  "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "isActive": true
}
```

**Option B: Using Setup Script**
```bash
# Edit scripts/setup-admin.js with your Firebase config first
node scripts/setup-admin.js
```

### 5. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 6. Open Browser
Navigate to `http://localhost:3001`

Login with:
- **Email**: `admin@test.com`
- **Password**: `password123`

## üéØ What You'll See

### Dashboard Features (Working with Mock Data)
- ‚úÖ **Dashboard Overview** - Stats cards, charts, recent activity
- ‚úÖ **User Management** - View users from your mobile app
- ‚úÖ **Event Management** - View events from your mobile app  
- ‚úÖ **Analytics** - Mock charts and data visualization
- ‚úÖ **Settings** - Configuration panels

### Real Data Integration
The dashboard will show **real data** from your mobile app:

- Events created by organizers
- Tickets purchased
- All Firebase collections

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Access Denied" Error
**Problem**: Can't login or see "Access Denied"
**Solution**: Make sure admin user exists in Firestore `admins` collection

### "Firebase Not Connected"  
**Problem**: Can't connect to Firebase
**Solution**: 
1. Check `.env` file has correct Firebase config
2. Verify Firebase project is active
3. Check browser console for errors

### "No Data Showing"
**Problem**: Dashboard shows empty or mock data
**Solution**:
1. Make sure you're using the same Firebase project as mobile app
2. Check if mobile app has created users/events
3. Verify Firestore collections exist (`users`, `events`, etc.)

### Build Errors
**Problem**: TypeScript or build errors
**Solution**:
```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules dist .vite
npm install
npm run dev
```
